#Please confirm the output is as expected before testing in-game.

#In this file you can specify the triggers, factors and conditions in which the music will play in-game.
#'mood' music is background music.
#The 'pause_factor' is a user-defined measure of how "heavy" the music is. When a song is played, its weight is added to a global counter. When that global counter reaches 100 it resets and the game pauses all music for a short period of time. This is give the listener some respite from any chain of potentially oerhwelming music tracks.
#'can_be_interrupted' determines whether the music track can be overriden by other music, such as event-triggered music.
#'is_prioritized_mood' will give the music track a 100% chance of playing the first time it is able to be played. Thereafter, it will be played at random with the same weighting as other mood-type music tracks. "no" disables this behaviour and makes the music track play as normal.

#NOTE: this tool does not generate code for event-triggered music. If you want it, you will need to do this yourself... sorry!
