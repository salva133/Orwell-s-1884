  OCE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Oceania, a vast superstate stretching across the Americas, is a land of strict control and unyielding authority. Governed by the principles of IngSoc, Oceania's society is a testament to the power of the state over the individual, where surveillance and propaganda are tools of governance."
  ASO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Airstrip One, formerly known as Great Britain, stands as the core of Oceania's power in the European theater. It is a land where the past is rewritten, and the present is under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother."
